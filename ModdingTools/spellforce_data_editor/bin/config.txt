# Ignore pragma
# Rest of the settings file will not be read
# ! Ignore

# VSync allowed values: YES, NO
# Enabling VSync will increase smoothness of the map editor view, but at the cost of increased CPU usage
# Low spec setting: NO, default: NO
VSync NO

# IgnoredMipMapsCount allowed values: 0, 1, 2
# The lower the value, the lower quality the textures, but the faster loading time and the lower VRAM usage
# Low spec setting: 2, default: 0
IgnoredMipMapsCount 0

# MaximumAllowedTextureSize allowed values: 64, 128, 256, ...
# The higher the value, the better quality textures will be loaded in if possible, but at the cost of longer loading times and higher VRAM usage
# Low spec setting: 256, default: 2048
MaximumAllowedTextureSize 2048

# EnableShadows allowed values: YES, NO
# Disabling shadows will increase performance
# Low spec setting: NO, default: YES
EnableShadows YES

# ShadingQuality allowed values: NONE, LOW, HIGH
# Shading quality affects the look of objects under various lighting conditions
# The lower, the better performance
# Low spec setting: LOW, default value: HIGH
ShadingQuality HIGH

# ShadowType allowed values: VSM, MSM
# Shadow technique used in map editor; VSM is less accurate, but cheaper
# Default value: MSM
ShadowType MSM

# SoftShadows allowed values: YES, NO
# Soft shadows are more pleasing to the eye, but bring a hefty cost in performance
# Default value: YES
SoftShadows YES

# AntiAliasingSamples allowed values: 0, 2, 4
# 0 means no antialiasing, which may increase performance
# Low spec setting: 0, default: 4
AntiAliasingSamples 4

# AnisotropicFiltering allowed values: YES, NO
# YES will improve texture appearance at steep angles, but will be more taxing on GPU
# Low spec setting: NO, default: YES
AnisotropicFiltering YES

# ShadowMapSize allowed values: 64 or more
# The higher the value, the better quality of shadows, but the worse performance
# Low spec setting: 512 (also see EnableShadows), default: 2048
ShadowMapSize 2048

# ToneMapping allowed values: YES, NO
# YES will enable post-processing (sky, fog, hdr/tonemap)
# Low spec setting: NO, default: YES
ToneMapping YES

# TerrainLOD allowed values: NONE, TESSELATION
# NONE will use max level terrain detail regardless of distance to camera - highest quality, but extensive GPU usage
# TESSELATION will dynamically calculate level of detail for terrain - medium quality, faster than NONE
# Low spec setting: TESSELATION, default: NONE
TerrainLOD NONE

# TerrainTextureLOD allowed values: NO, YES, EXTREME
# YES will cause the terrain to lose details further away from camera
# EXTREME will cause the terrain to lose details everywhere unless map editor is in terrain texture edit mode
# Use EXTREME when you experience heavy performance issues
# Low spec setting: YES, default: NO
TerrainTextureLOD NO

# ObjectFadeDistance allowed values: X Y as numbers greater than 0, where X is less than Y
# The higher values, the further the object can be seen away from camera
# Consequently, more objects will be visible, therefore lower values may improve performance
# Low spec setting: 80 120, default: 170 220
ObjectFadeDistance 170 220

# UnitFadeDistance allowed values X as a number greater than 0
# The higher value, the further the unit can be seen away from camera
# Consequently, more units will be visible, therefore lower values may improve performance
# Low spec setting: 61, default: 91
UnitFadeDistance 91

# DecorationFadeDistance allowed values X as a number greater than 0
# The higher value, the further decorations can be seen away from camera
# Consequently, more decorations will be visible, therefore lower values may improve performance
# Low spec setting: 41, default: 71
DecorationFadeDistance 71

# FramesPerSecond allowed values: 5 or more, up to 1000
# The higher the value, the more fluid the motion in editor and asset viewer will be, but at the expense of higher cpu/gpu usage
# Low spec setting: 25, default: 60
# Temporarily, values 40 and 200 are used to simulate the values above
FramesPerSecond 200

# GameDirectory is a path parameter, it should point at the folder with Spellforce.exe. Editor will ask you for a path, so you don't need to do it manually
# When specified, editor will try to preload data from PAKs found in the GameDirectory/pak folder
# Some editor features require this to be a valid parameter
GameDirectory H:\SpellSmut\OriginalGameFiles

# LanguageID allowed values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
# Sets language id of text entries used by editor; it's good to set it to match your game's LanguageID (you can see language IDs on text entry preview in category 15 of gamedata editor)
LanguageID 1

# LogInfo/Warning/Error allowed values: YES, NO
# Sets log level option to be set on or off
LogInfo YES
LogWarning YES
LogError YES

# GameRunArguments allowed values: any valid SpellForce.exe command args
# for example: GameRunArguments -windowed
GameRunArguments 

# ExtractDirectory is a path parameter
# Assets will be extracted to this directory when using "Extract" option in Asset Viewer
# If left empty, editor directory will be set as extract directory
ExtractDirectory 

# ExtractAllInOne allowed values: YES, NO
# If set to NO, assets will be extracted to ExtractDirectory/spec_dir each, where:
# - mesh files spec_dir = mesh
# - skeleton files spec_dir = animation
# - texture files spec_dir = texture
# - etc.
# If set to YES, all assets will be extracted directly to ExtractDirectory
# Set it to YES if you want to use Blender plugins to edit those files, leave at NO otherwise
# Default value: NO
ExtractAllInOne NO
