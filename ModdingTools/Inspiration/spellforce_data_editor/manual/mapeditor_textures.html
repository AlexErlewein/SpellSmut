<h1>Map Editor - Textures mode</h1>
<p>After you're done modifying terrain, you need to paint it. In this mode, you can paint the terrain using a set of base textures, create custom textures, adjust base texture set, and more.</p>

<h2>Editor tool panel</h2>

<h2>Painting the terrain</h2>
<p>To paint the terrain, adjust brush settings (see <a href="mapeditor_terrain.html#HMAP">Map Editor - Terrain mode</a> for brush details), select the texture from Texture Selection panel, and then hold <b>left mouse button</b> and drag the mouse over the terrain you want to paint.</p>
<p>In addition, if <b>Shift</b> is held while left mouse button is pressed, the currently selected texture will be applied to <warning>all</warning> terrain, regardless of brush settings.</p>
<p><warning>All terrain should be painted with some texture. You can't paint terrain at height 0. Setting terrain height to 0 will remove texture from it.</warning></p>
<p>Using <b>right mouse button</b> you can select texture to paint with from under the 3D cursor.</p>

<h3>Modify texture set</h3>
<p><i>Modify texture set</i> button brings up a window in which you can select base textures that your map uses. Every map is limited to 31 base textures (excluding base texture).</p>

<h2>Texture Selection panel</h2>
<p>When you enter Textures mode, Texture Selection panel appears on the right of the view panel, depending on <i>Tile type</i> selected in tool panel.</p>
<img src="img/mapedittexpanel.png">
<p>In either case, selecting a texture from the panel allows you to paint the terrain with it.</p>
<p>Also in either case, you can choose whether the texture acts as a movement flag and/or a vision flag. <warning>Texture vision flag likely doesn't work!</warning></p>
<h3>Custom texture selection panel</h3>
<p>In this panel, you can create additional textures, which are mixtures of existing textures. Select a texture from this panel to enable editing the texture.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A. Here are base textures which are mixed into this custom texture. Clicking on any of those opens a window in which you can choose another base texture to mix with.</li>
  <li>B. Here are base texture weights which are used to mix the textures. They should sum up to 255 or close to this value. In the screenshot above, two textures are mixed together, each with the same weight of 127, meaning each of the textures contributes to 50% of the custom texture's result color. As the third texture has weight 0, it doesn't contribute to the custom texture's result color.</li>
</ul>
