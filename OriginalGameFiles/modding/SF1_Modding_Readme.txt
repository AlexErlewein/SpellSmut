We finally are able to ship more mod possibilities for SpellForce!

In the folder "3D Converter" there is a tool that can convert SpellForce assets to FBX and also create FBX files to the game ready SpellForce 3D
format. Please mind the readme file "SF1_FBX_ReadMe.pdf"

In the folder "Source Scripts" are the uncompiled lua files use for mapscripts and some core gameplay systems. The game can perfectly work with
uncompiled script files. You just need to copy it into the same folder structure as on the "Source Script" folder in the <root> folder for the game
to recognize it.

We look forward for your feedback and suggestions to improve modding the game.
We would love to see you around in our Discord server at discord.gg/spellforce (there is a dedicated modding channel #spellforce1_mods) and the Steam community forums
of SpellForce Platinum Edition at: https://steamcommunity.com/app/39540/discussions/

Enjoy modding SpellForce!
