# Icon System - Next Steps & Planning

## Completed ✅

1. **Item Icon Extraction**
   - 27,648 icons from 432 atlases
   - 32×32 pixels, 8×8 grid, no offset
   - Working correctly

2. **Spell Icon Extraction** 
   - 162 icons from 18 atlases
   - 64×64 pixels, 4×4 grid
   - (3,3) offset for centering
   - 180° rotation applied
   - Working correctly

3. **Empty Icon Detection**

   - Identified 2,070 empty icons (32.2%)
   - Created visual report and metadata
   - Icon index updated with `is_empty` flags

4. **Interactive GUI Mapper**
   - PyQt6 interface created
   - Manual verification capability
   - Saves to `verified_icon_mappings.json`

5. **CFF Editor Integration**
   - Icon data loading on startup
   - 4-tier priority system
   - Automatic empty icon avoidance

## Step 3: Check Other Categories (IN PROGRESS)

**Status**: Analyzing bgr, btn, oth, cnt, itm, logo categories

**Goal**: Determine if other categories need special extraction settings (offset, rotation, different grid sizes)

**Categories to Check**:
- `bgr` (1,161 atlases) - Backgrounds? 256×256
- `btn` (77 atlases) - Buttons? 256×256
- `oth` (9 atlases) - Other UI? 256×256
- `cnt` (37 atlases) - Unknown, 256×256
- `itm` (16 atlases) - Items variant? 256×256
- `logo` (4 atlases) - Logos, 512×512

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Visual inspection of sample atlases
- [ ] Determine actual grid patterns used
- [ ] Test extraction with detected settings
- [ ] Document findings
- [ ] Update extraction script if needed

---

## Step 4: Test CFF Editor Integration

**Goal**: Verify end-to-end functionality with corrected spell icons

**Prerequisites**: 
- Step 3 complete (know all icon formats)
- All icons properly extracted

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Launch CFF editor
- [ ] Load GameData.cff file
- [ ] Navigate to item editor
- [ ] Verify item icons display correctly
- [ ] Navigate to spell editor (if exists)
- [ ] Verify spell icons display correctly
- [ ] Test icon priority system (verified > automatic > fallback)
- [ ] Test empty icon avoidance
- [ ] Check icon loading performance
- [ ] Document any issues found

**Considerations**:
- Does spell data in CFF have icon references?
- Are spell icons referenced by handle or index?
- Do we need to build spell icon mappings?
- Performance: 6,434 icons - is loading fast enough?

---

## Step 5: Manual Verification GUI

**Goal**: Build verified mapping database for high-priority items

**Strategy**:
1. Identify "important" items to verify first:
   - Unique/legendary weapons
   - Quest items
   - Key consumables
   - Special equipment

2. Use interactive GUI to manually verify:
   - Load item by handle/name
   - View assigned icon
   - Search through atlases if wrong
   - Assign correct icon
   - Save to verified database

3. Build priority list:
   - How many items total?
   - Which items are most commonly used?
   - Which items have incorrect auto-mappings?

**Considerations**:
- Time investment: Manual verification is slow
- ROI: Is it worth verifying all items?
- Alternative: Only verify items that are reported wrong
- Could we improve automatic mapping instead?

**Questions to Answer**:
- [ ] How many items exist in total?
- [ ] What percentage have icons currently?
- [ ] What's the accuracy of auto-mapping?
- [ ] Sample 50 items - how many are correct?
- [ ] Is there a pattern to incorrect mappings?

## Step 6: Build Complete Icon Mapping System

**Goal**: Create comprehensive handle-to-icon lookup system

**Current State**:
- Icons extracted and indexed
- Icon index has: category, atlas_number, icon_index, path
- GameData.json has: item handles, item_ui_index values
- NO direct connection between handle and actual icon file

**Architecture Plan**:

### Phase 1: Automatic Mapping
Build mapping from GameData.json analysis:

```python
# GameData.json structure (example):
{
  "item_equip_weapon_dagger_flame": {
    "item_ui_category": "ui_item",  # -> category = "item"
    "item_ui_texture": 14,           # -> atlas_number = "14"
    "item_ui_index": 3               # -> icon_index = 3
  }
}

# Generates lookup:
{
  "item_equip_weapon_dagger_flame": {
    "icon_key": "item_14_003",
    "icon_path": "item/atlas_14/icon_003.png",
    "confidence": "automatic"
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Smart Fallbacks
For items without icon data:
- Name similarity matching
- Category-based defaults
- Visual feature detection

### Phase 3: Manual Overrides
Integrate verified mappings:
- Priority: verified > automatic > fallback
- Track verification status
- Allow community contributions

### Phase 4: API
Create lookup functions:

```python
def get_icon(handle: str) -> Path:
    """Get icon path for item handle."""
    
def get_icon_info(handle: str) -> dict:
    """Get full icon metadata."""
    
def search_icons(query: str) -> list:
    """Search for icons by name/category."""
```

**Considerations**:
- **Data Quality**: Are item_ui_* fields complete in GameData.json?
- **Missing Data**: What % of items have icon references?
- **Spells**: Do spells have similar fields? Different structure?
- **Performance**: Cache mappings? Lazy load?
- **Updates**: How to handle game data updates?

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Analyze GameData.json structure
  - [ ] Count items with icon data
  - [ ] Identify field names for spells
  - [ ] Check data completeness
  - [ ] Document edge cases

- [ ] Build automatic mapper
  - [ ] Parse GameData.json
  - [ ] Extract icon references
  - [ ] Validate against icon_index.json
  - [ ] Generate mapping.json

- [ ] Test mapping accuracy
  - [ ] Sample random items
  - [ ] Visual verification
  - [ ] Measure success rate

- [ ] Integrate with CFF editor
  - [ ] Update data_model.py
  - [ ] Add icon lookup methods
  - [ ] Test performance

## Open Questions

### Data Structure
- [ ] What icon fields exist in spell data?
- [ ] Are there other entity types with icons? (buildings, units, etc.)
- [ ] What's in the other categories (bgr, btn, oth)?

### Performance
- [ ] Icon loading speed acceptable?
- [ ] Need icon caching?
- [ ] Memory usage with 6K+ icons?

### Accuracy
- [ ] What's auto-mapping success rate?
- [ ] Common failure patterns?
- [ ] Worth investing in ML/similarity matching?

### Scope
- [ ] Extract ALL categories or just item/spell?
- [ ] Build mappings for non-game entities?
- [ ] Support modded icons?

---

## Success Criteria

**Step 3**: All categories analyzed, extraction settings documented
**Step 4**: CFF editor displays icons correctly, no crashes, acceptable performance
**Step 5**: High-priority items verified, tools exist for on-demand verification  
**Step 6**: Automatic mapping working, >90% accuracy, integrated with editor
**Step 7**: Complete documentation, new users can extract and use icons

---

## Timeline Estimates

- **Step 3**: 1-2 hours (depends on findings)
- **Step 6 Phase 1**: 2-4 hours (data analysis + implementation)
- **Step 4**: 1 hour (testing + fixes)
- **Step 6 Phase 2-3**: 2-3 hours (algorithm improvements)
- **Step 5**: Ongoing (as needed)
- **Step 7**: 3-4 hours (comprehensive docs)

**Total**: ~10-15 hours for complete system

---

## Notes

- Focus on item/spell icons first (core functionality)
- Other categories may not need extraction (UI elements, not game content)
- Prioritize working system over perfect accuracy
- Can iterate on accuracy after basic functionality works
- Community could help with manual verification later
