# Unofficial Spellforce Modding Documentation

This documentation has been created and tested with version 1.54 of the game.

The lua source files are available at: https://github.com/THQNordic/SpellForceLUASources

The source files include German documentation for various tables accessible to mod creators. Regrettably, some aspects are not clearly explained, and further testing reveals that many tables do not function as anticipated. You'll see examples of some of these when you go through this Unofficial Documentation. 

This documentation will include the translated Lua documentation snippets, additional information, insights from in-game testing, and guides on implementing specific scripts and additions.
